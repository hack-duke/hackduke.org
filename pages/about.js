                                    A group of 3 Duke and UNC students—Dennis
                                    Li, Yang Su, and Katie Hawthorne—organized
                                    the first hackathon at Duke to get people
                                    excited about learning and creating things
                                    outside the classroom.

                            In 2014, we introduced the core concept of hacking

                            participated as experts to lead discussions and help

                            This [hackathon] has inspired more students to work
                            on problems that are related to social good. It has
                            also opened the eyes of more non-profits of the
                            potential of technology. HackDuke is not a solution
                            to society&apos;s problems. It&apos;s the beginning
                            of the journey in identifying them, and exploring
                            the solutions to them.

                            As the hackathon expanded, we continued to engage

                            HackDuke Education, where we brought speakers in
                            tech and social justice, educational workshops,
                            career panels, and more to the Duke community. By
                            2016, we no longer just hosted hackathons. HackDuke
                            became an umbrella organization for multiple
                            projects: Code for Good (the OG hackathon), Catalyst
                            (social/pre-professional tech org), and more. We
                            became the face of Duke&apos;s tech community,
                            responsible for engaging, educating, and inspiring
