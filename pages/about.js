                            to think critically about the role of technology in

                                    A group of 3 Duke and UNC students—Dennis
                                    Li, Yang Su, and Katie Hawthorne—organized
                                    the first hackathon at Duke to get people
                                    excited about learning and creating things
                                    outside the classroom.

                                    hours. The event attracted ~100 students.
                                    Later that year, our organization was
                                    renamed to HackDuke and continued to grow.

                            In 2014, we introduced the core concept of hacking
                            for social good. Local non-profits like the
                            Community Empowerment Fund and Durham Cares
                            participated as experts to lead discussions and help
                            teams identify community problems and develop
                            meaningful solutions.

                            This [hackathon] has inspired more students to work

                            also opened the eyes of more non-profits of the
                            potential of technology. HackDuke is not a solution

                            As the hackathon expanded, we continued to engage
                            with the Duke community through new initiatives like
                            HackDuke Education, where we brought speakers in
                            tech and social justice, educational workshops,
                            career panels, and more to the Duke community. By
                            2016, we no longer just hosted hackathons. HackDuke
                            became an umbrella organization for multiple
                            projects: Code for Good (the OG hackathon), Catalyst
                            (social/pre-professional tech org), and more. We
                            became the face of Duke’s tech community,
                            responsible for engaging, educating, and inspiring
                            students with both technical and non-technical
